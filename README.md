Carlos is late

The icons don't tell you what they are, but that maybe okay. Contact me page doesn't have the same theme as every other page. Home is the only one with all navigation. There's no way to know which page you are on in navigation bar. Projects page is too wide. The reflections page has the navigation arrows pretty low on the page.

Cierra is late

Thomas (6:42)
Send us feedback should say contact. There's still a lot of space on Skills page. There's nothing telling you about hovering over the skills on the left on the projects page. A lot of empty space on the Education page.

Shoshard is late

It's difficult to read tabs. Needs margins on the about me page. It's diffcult to read the words on the skils page. Hard to read the education page. Text is too large. Text to too large on Journey page, then too small. Text is hard to read. Background images need to be consistant. Embedded contact info needs to be centered.

Gerren (6:20)
Text is too large on page. His browser may be zoomed in too far. Project text is not correct. All links are purprle. Make the resume download button look more diliberate. 

Rob (5:16)
The dark green is a little too dark on the dark background. The text is again too dark on the about me page. Text is too small on the skills page. His project page should link directly to the project, not to his page. What the school page education? If so that, okay. Make sure if you click on the resume it downloads. It would also be great to see an embeded resume.

I'Tayanna is late

Clyde (6:36). At first he pushed an empty folder. All of his code wasn't in the correct folder.
It makes it look like your name is Linus Torvald. About me text is too small and has no margins. Project page should be a picture of your project, not the code. Also, the github link should be a link to your actual projet, not github.com. Your contact info could be embeded so you don't leave your user confused. 

Betty (7:00)
Try to get the first page on one page. Make the text larger. Too much empty space. Make it obvious when you're on the page you clicked. If there's time, make each image a link as welll to the project repository. What is the button on the bottom of the resume page? Weekly Reflections left column should be bigger. 

Chelsea (5:25)
The page should be 100% of height with no scroll. Make text a little larger. What was on the top of the resume page. It looks like we're missing information that we should have. Contact page is completely differently themed than everything else. It should look similar. Are you allowed to use the video? 

Porche (7:03)
The text is too dark on the dark background. Her about me picture is not fixed. Too much empty space on resume page. Download resume should be higher on page. Portfolio projects should be smaller to fit page. Contact page should be centered. She said she copied and paste the hamburger menu and video carosel.

Melaati (7:29)
Images on the home page are too large. There is too much text without line breaks. It makes it harder to read too much text. Make sure you use words to tell people what each logo means on your skills. There are a lot of pictures that are to large.
Positive: She used boostrap, but could explain what it was so it's allowed and no points taken off. I could tell she didn't just copy and paste the carosel. Maybe with the navbar.


Didier (). Didn't have his final code pushed at 8am. He asked for me to use his code 30mins after deadline (which was 30mins before class).
