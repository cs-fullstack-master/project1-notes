The icons don't tell you what they are, but that maybe okay. Contact me page doesn't have the same theme as every other page. Home is the only one with all navigation. There's no way to know which page you are on in navigation bar. Projects page is too wide. The reflections page has the navigation arrows pretty low on the page.

Send us feedback should say contact. There's still a lot of space on Skills page. There's nothing telling you about hovering over the skills on the left on the projects page. A lot of empty space on the Education page.

It's difficult to read tabs. Needs margins on the about me page. It's diffcult to read the words on the skils page. Hard to read the education page. Text is too large. Text to too large on Journey page, then too small. Text is hard to read. Background images need to be consistant. Embedded contact info needs to be centered.

Text is too large on page. His browser may be zoomed in too far. Project text is not correct. All links are purprle. Make the resume download button look more diliberate.

The dark green is a little too dark on the dark background. The text is again too dark on the about me page. Text is too small on the skills page. His project page should link directly to the project, not to his page. What the school page education? If so that, okay. Make sure if you click on the resume it downloads. It would also be great to see an embeded resume.

Clyde pushed an empty folder. All of his code wasn't in the correct folder.

Try to get the first page on one page. Make the text larger. Too much empty space. Make it obvious when you're on the page you clicked. If there's time, make each image a link as welll to the project repository. What is the button on the bottom of the resume page? Weekly Reflections left column should be bigger.

The page should be 100% of height with no scroll. Make text a little larger. What was on the top of the resume page. It looks like we're missing information that we should have. Contact page is completely differently themed than everything else. It should look similar. Are you allowed to use the video?
